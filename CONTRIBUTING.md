# Contributing to GRID

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to GRID!

There are several ways in which you can contribute, beyond writing code. The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Asking Questions

- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GRID-Editor/GRID/discussions)

## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem in GRID? Do you have a feature request? We want to hear about it! Here's how you can report your issue as effectively as possible.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/GRID-Editor/GRID/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your reaction. Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Version of GRID
* Your operating system
* List of extensions that you have installed
* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue
* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw
* Images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring
* A code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally
* Errors from the Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

### Creating Pull Requests

Please refer to the [HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md](./HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md) guide for detailed instructions on setting up your development environment and creating pull requests.

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue
* [ ] Simplify your code around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue right away. They will simply ask for more information!

## Contributing Code

Once submitted, your report will go into our issue tracking workflow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect and how to continue to assist throughout the process.

## Contributing Fixes

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, please see [HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md](./HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE.md) for details on setting up your development environment.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Please submit a pull request once you've made a change.
- No need to submit an Issue unless you're creating a new feature that might involve multiple PRs.
- Please don't use AI to write your PR 🙂
