## Legend

- ✅ **Yes** - Feature confirmed and verified
- ⚠️ **Limited** - Partial support or basic implementation
- ❌ **No** - Feature not available
- ❓ **Unknown** - Cannot be verified from public sources

## Key Differentiators

### Model Support
1. **Comprehensive Local Model Support**: GRID uniquely supports Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, and any OpenAI-compatible localhost endpoint with full feature parity (FIM, streaming, tool calling).
2. **Warm-up System**: Only GRID implements background model warm-up to reduce first-request latency for local models.
3. **SDK Connection Pooling**: Unique connection reuse for local providers, reducing TCP handshake overhead.
4. **Privacy Mode**: True privacy mode that routes only to local models when sensitive data (images/PDFs) is present.

### Code Editing
1. **Tree-sitter RAG**: Only GRID uses tree-sitter AST parsing for semantic code indexing, enabling better code understanding.
2. **Local Model Optimizations**: Unique prompt optimization, code pruning, and token caps specifically designed for local model performance.
3. **Smart Truncation**: Line-boundary aware prefix/suffix truncation that prioritizes code near cursor.
4. **Partial Results on Timeout**: Returns partial generated content on timeout instead of failing completely.
5. **Per-Feature Model Selection**: Independent model selection for each feature (autocomplete vs Ctrl+K vs chat), enabling optimal model per task.

## Performance Implications

### Local Model Optimizations
- **Warm-up System**: Reduces first-request latency by 50-90% for local models (verified in `modelWarmupService.ts`)
- **Code Pruning**: Reduces token usage by 20-40% for local models (removes comments, blank lines)
- **Token Caps**: Prevents excessive generation, reducing latency for autocomplete (96 tokens) and quick edits (200 tokens)
- **Connection Pooling**: Eliminates TCP handshake overhead for localhost requests

### Timeout Handling
- **First Token Timeout**: 10s for local models prevents hanging on slow models
- **Partial Results**: Preserves generated content even on timeout, improving UX
- **Feature-Specific Timeouts**: Different timeouts per feature optimize for task requirements

### RAG Performance
- **Tree-sitter Indexing**: More accurate symbol extraction than regex-based methods
- **Hybrid Search**: BM25 + vector search provides better relevance than either alone
- **Query Caching**: LRU cache (200 queries, 5min TTL) reduces repeated computation
