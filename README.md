# GRID

GRID is the open-source Cursor alternative.

**GRID is a distinct, independent project that has evolved far beyond its origins.** While it started as a fork of Visual Studio Code, it has been **significantly re-architected and optimized**. We have focused on fixing inherited issues and streamlining the core to provide a superior, AI-native development experience. This is no longer just a fork; it is a proper, unique repository.

Use AI agents on your codebase, checkpoint and visualize changes, and bring any model or host locally. GRID sends messages directly to providers without retaining your data.

This repo contains the full sourcecode for GRID. If you're new, welcome!

## Acknowledgements

While GRID is now a distinct and independent project, we acknowledge that it began as a fork of Microsoft's [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode). We appreciate the foundation they provided, which allowed us to build something entirely new and significantly more advanced. We have since diverged completely to create a superior experience for our users.

For a guide to the codebase, see [GRID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md](./docs/GRID_CODEBASE_GUIDE.md).
